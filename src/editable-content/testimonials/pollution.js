      "This was by far the most detailed and informative course that I have ever participated in. I would definitely recommend this course to my colleagues in the hydrogeology field. I look forward to taking the Remediation Course. I sat for the ASBOG exam in the 2 weeks prior to taking the course. I only wish that I would have been able to take this course prior to my exams. The breath of information presented in the course was an excellent cross section of topics that were covered in the Practice of Geology exam. Overall this was an excellent experience, reminding me of my time as a grad student (M.S.) working with Dr. Jeff Kuo at Cal State University-Fullerton. It was nice to see Dr. Kuo's book used as a Key Reference.",
