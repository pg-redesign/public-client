const longDescription = `The widespread interest in groundwater contamination, characterization and remediation has seen the offering of many two- and three-day training courses dealing with various aspects of the problem. There are no other one-week courses covering all aspects. The emphasis is on acquiring an extensive working knowledge of the concepts, principles and professional practices underlying groundwater contamination, hydrology and remediation.

The advantages of a longer course include time to cover and absorb more aspects of this expanding field and the opportunity for in-depth technical learning. Groundwater legislation, high resolution site characterization, remediation techniques, natural attenuation, risk assessment, wellhead protection techniques, multi-level monitoring systems, LNAPL/ DNAPL contamination, indoor air vapor intrusion, emerging contaminants and applications of computer modeling have grown to such an extent in the last few decades that intensive one-week courses, with a few early evening sessions are needed to adequately cover all of these new developments.
One of the most widespread and difficult problems in groundwater contamination and remediation today is dense non-aqueous phase liquids (DNAPLs). Dr. John Cherry, one of the world’s leading experts in this area, will present the fundamental concepts underlying the occurrence, behavior, movement and characterization of DNAPLs in unconsolidated sedimentary deposits, aquitards and fractured hard rocks.

Although some areas are necessarily surveyed in the interest of time, technical depth is the norm in the majority of sessions. This is the highest rated course in the industry because of the unparalleled technical information and applied knowledge it provides - no course teaches so much! Among groundwater professionals, the Princeton Groundwater Pollution and Hydrology Course is considered a must course of outstanding educational value
